# My config files for macOS [![Thanks](http://bit.ly/saythankss)](https://github.com/users/nikitavoloboev/sponsorship)

> Zsh, Karabiner, VS Code, Sublime, Neovim, Nix

I don't actually split editors like above. I code with each window maximized & switch quickly between windows/apps with Karabiner. Sometimes I use iPad with Sidecar on the side (for web dev) but mostly use one 16" MacBook screen.

You can see my top used apps, Safari extensions and Alfred workflows [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os). I also explain how I use the apps in detail there.

## Clean install

1. Boot latest macOS version. Remember that username is the name you want the home folder to be (by default its first name & last name).
2. Go through [preferences](https://imgur.com/a/KoVAxFQ) & set everything up.
3. Download & install [apps I use](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os).
4. Clone dotfiles & sync them.
5. [Sync settings](https://github.com/zenangst/Syncalicious) for apps I use.

## Setup & sync dotfiles

Take a look at [install](install) shell script. It will install [brew](https://brew.sh), [go](https://go.dev) & [mage](https://github.com/magefile/mage).

Run it with `./install`. As part of the script it will run `mage setup`. Take a look at [magefile.go](magefile.go) `Setup` function to see what it will do.

You can also run `mage` alone to see what commands you can run with descriptions of them.

In short, it will create appropriate symlinks pointing at files in `~/.dotfiles`. It is assumed that the dotfiles repo is placed there.

It will also install CLI tools & apps.

## Interesting dotfiles

[Here](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/unix/dotfiles) are dotfiles I got many ideas from and liked. I also mention [Nix configurations I liked](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/operating-systems/linux/nixos).

## Contributing

[Suggestions](../../issues/) on how I can improve the these dotfiles or suggestions of new and awesome tools are welcome.
